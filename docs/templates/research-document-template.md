## Abstract

_Describe briefly what does topic represents and what it does_

Example: A vector database uses data embeddings to match similar things together through embeddings (a vector of numbers). It usually uses Approximate-Near-Neighbor Search (ANN) to search by a vector key. It is useful for keeping historical data together to be used by LLM applications or to assist in searching and recommendations systems.

## How it works

_Explain in detail (also using diagrams or state-machines) how it functions_

Example: At its core, most implementations use ANN which works the following way... --insert diagrams and present--.

## Use Cases

_Enumerate how the topic can be applied_

Example: - Enhance LLM Applications by offering context information or as a long-term memory.

## Implementations

_Enumerate libraries that implement or can be used to implement this topic_

Example: - PgVector (https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).

## Advantages

_Enumerate what are the advantages of the topic_

Example: - Provides a quick way to group and find similar data of any kind (e.g.: image, text).

## Limitations/Disadvantages

_Enumerate what are the disadvantages or technical limitations of the topic_

Example: - Chaning the embedding system causes the re-indexing of the whole Vector DB.

## Alternatives

_Enumerate with brief details what are some formal alternatives to these solutions or provide what future directions can be taken from this topic_

Example: - Neural Database. - Applying it to RAG systems.

## Formal Definitions

_Provide formal definitions of relevant terms in document_

Example: - Neural Database. - Applying it to RAG systems.

## Useful Links

_Provide links and reference documents used in the topic research_

Example: - Vector Embeddings: Vector embeddings numerically capture the semantic meaning of the objects in relation to other objects.

## Appendices

_Used if relevant for any supplementary materials or extended examples_
